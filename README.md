```

## ðŸ“Œ Usage

Each problem is organized into a separate directory and contains the problem statement, the C++ source code solution, and a sample input/output file.

To run a specific problem, navigate to its directory and compile the C++ source code using your preferred C++ compiler. For example, to compile `problem.cpp`, use the following command:

```bash
   g++ problem.cpp -o problem
```

After successful compilation, you can run the executable file (e.g., `problem.exe` on Windows or `./problem` on Linux/Mac) to execute the code and see the output.

```bash
   ./problem
```
